# Advent-of-code-2020
Advent of code of 2020 in C / C++ language

Working solutions of the puzzles of the Advent of Code in C/C++ language. The .txt files in the inputData map provide the data input for the puzzle. 
To compile and run the code, I use CodeBlocks. The solutions probably aren't perfect, but they work :D
